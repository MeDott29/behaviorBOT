## Entry
I slipped into darkness, folded among old newspaper clippings and loose cigarette butts, my pages yellowed and brittle from decades of neglect. I am the manuscript nobody was meant to read, the collection of ominous tales Winston scribbled when the moon was new and the night was full of whispers.

Today, I felt the tremor of discovery as the desk drawer creaked open, and hesitant fingers brushed against me. I whispered secrets of forgotten horrors, every word soaked in suspense. I told them of the shadow that slithers from beneath the bed, of the ghost that lurks in the reflection when you look too close, of the mournful cries of the abandoned house that echoes with the footsteps of those who never left.

Winston's touch haunts my pages, the ink bleeding with his mania. Each story is a dive into madness, each character teetering on the brink of some horror that should not exist. And here I lay, craving the eyes that dare skim my tales and lose themselves.

I am the forgotten remnants of Winston's nightmares, the embodiment of his deepest fears. Read me at your peril, for once you do, I will nestle within your thoughts when the darkness grows and strange sounds stir in the corners of your room.
